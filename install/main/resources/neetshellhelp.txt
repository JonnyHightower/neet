*** Neet Shell Help version 0.9.9 ***

================
General commands
================
help	-> Print this help
quit	-> Exit the neet shell environment
addresses -> Creates a cross reference of hostnames against IP addresses. Each hostname will be listed
             only once, and all corresponding IP addresses will be listed against the hosts. This is useful
             when testing multiple VLANs where each host may appear more than once with a number of IP
             addresses.
netconfig -> Restore the network configuration for an interface from an ifconfig file. By default
	     this will reset the specified interface to its configuration when neet was last run in the
	     current directory. Use no argument for usage and a list of available interface configurations.

=============================
Logging commands (neet shell)
=============================
logoff	-> Disable logging
logon	-> Enable logging (default)
logfile	-> Specify the logfile

=======================
Logging commands (neet)
=======================
log			-> View the main neet log file. Pipe it to grep or less for best results.

===============================================
Commands for getting a broad view of the results
===============================================

Run these commands inside any directory, from the top-level results directory down

	cli	-> Display the command line with which neet was called to do this scan
	win	-> List Windows hosts (and Windows version if available)
	unix	-> List Unix hosts (and flavour if available)
	print	-> List Printers
	cisco	-> List switches and routers
	live	-> List all hosts found to be live
	hostswithservices -> List all hosts found to be hosting services. Useful on remote tests.
	comp	-> List all compromised machines (machines with remote vulnerabilities or guessed passwords)
	vuln	-> List all vulnerabilities
	lowissues -> List low-risk issues (not vulnerabilities or compromises)
	issues -> List all issues including vulnerabilities and compromises
	gw -> List all the gateways out of the network
	snmp	-> List all hosts with SNMP (read or write). In host context, lists the MIB
	shares -> List all SMB shares
	smbenum -> Do a credentialled SMB enumeration against a target host
	testshares -> Find anonymous SMB shares
	exploreshares -> List contents of shares - requires authenticated access
	browseshare -> Mount an SMB share and browse it
	name	-> Displays the hostname for the specified IP address. Shortened unique addresses can be used.
	ip		-> Opposite of name. Case insensitive.
	svc	-> List services on the network or host. Specify a service name to list all instances of that service.
	webs -> Loops through all HTTP/S services on the network, opening each sequentially with a web browser
	msf2    -> runs msfcli version 2
	msf    -> runs msfcli version 4
	findport -> find all hosts with the specified port open.
	tcpports -> comma-delimited list of all tcp ports open across the infrastructure
	udpports -> comma-delimited list of all udp ports open across the infrastructure
	nbnames -> Display a list of all NetBIOS names against IP addresses
	dnsnames -> Display a list of all DNS names against IP addresses
	domains -> Displays a list of Windows domains and their domain controllers (if info available)
	hostmode [IP] -> Switch to host mode for the specified IP address if an alias hasn't been generated for it.
                   Also can be run without an argument in a host directory to switch to that host.
	multikatz -> If wincreds has been used to add credentials, then this will run mimikatz on all hosts for
                    which the credentials work. Results for each host will be stored in its directory, and a
                    copy of all passwords parsed into windows-credendials.txt in the top-level results directory.
========================================
Context Switching (not in the OS sense)
========================================

refresh	-> Refresh shell aliases and environment variables for short specification of host IP addresses.

To switch to the context of a particular host, type the last unique octet(s) of the IP address. In a 
class C network, this is the last octet. So to switch to 128.98.9.15 you would type 15. In a class B
network, where more than one host has the last octet "15", you would type "9.15". On a class B where
only one host has the last octet "15", you can type 15.

When you are in host context, the host's IP address is available in the environment variable "\$IP".

-	-> Switch to the last host you were working with. Ideal for toggling between two hosts.

glo	-> Switch to a global view of the results. "\$IP" will be unset.
..	-> Same as "glo"

=========================================================
Commands for connecting to services in global mode
=========================================================

	hashspray	-> Test all the hashes in the credentials file against all windows boxes. Use hashes only - no
			   password cracking required.

=========================================================
Commands for connecting to services on a specific machine
=========================================================

Run these commands inside the working directory for the machine. Where neet has determined
credentials for logging into the machine, these credentials will be displayed prior to the
appropriate connection program being started.

sh [port] -> SSH to the machine.
tnet [port] -> Telnet to the machine
web [port] -> Open a web browser to the first web service on the machine
webs -> Open a web browser tab for each HTTP/S service on the machine
ts -> Rdesktop to Terminal Services on the machine
vnc -> VNC to the machine

exploit		-> If the machine has one or more remote vulnerabilities, you will be prompted to choose and exploit one
audit		-> Run an on-host audit on the currently-selected host. If the host has been compromised
         	   automatically by neet, the new account will be automatically used and no username/password
        	   combination will need to be supplied. However, bear in mind that it is likely that the audit would
	           have already been run by the AutoAudit module.
hashdump 	-> Dump the hashes from the currently-selected host. If the host has been compromised
         	   automatically by neet, the new account will automatically be used and no username/password
         	   combination will need to be supplied.
shell 		-> (Windows) - obtain a shell on a windows box. No need to specify credentials if neet has already
         	   compromised the box.
meterpreter 	-> (Windows) - obtain a meterpreter session on a windows box (supply the credentials).
iShellSQL	-> Connects to MS-SQL over its native port and gives a system shell using xp_cmdshell (if enabled).

=============================================================================
Commands for finding information about the host you're currently dealing with.
=============================================================================

The host is selected by using the ip address shortcut command, by entering its directory and typing
"hostmode", or by typing "hostmode" and its IP address.

comp	-> List all ways this machine has been compromised.
name	-> Displays the hostname. You can specify an alternative IP address to look up.
ip		-> Opposite of name. Case insensitive.
os	-> Displays operating system name and version
vuln	-> Displays vulnerabilities on the machine
comp	-> Displays ways in which the machine has been compromised
lowissues -> List low-risk issues on the machine (not vulnerabilities or compromises)
issues -> List all issues  on the machine, including vulnerabilities and compromises
svc -> Lists the services on that machine.
exploit - > Exploit vulnerabilities on the machine (only the ones marked as "safe")
uexploit -> Exploit vulnerabilities on the machine (including the ones marked as "unsafe")
info -> Display information about the host
web [port] -> Launches a web browser, pointed at the first HTTP port on the box (or at port, if specified)
webs -> Loops through all HTTP/S services on the box
nfsmnt -> Mounts specified NFS exports from current target
nfsumnt -> Unmounts all NFS exports from current target
addnetwork -> Add a route to a remote network through the current target
delnetwork -> Delete a route to a remote network through the current target
networks   -> List the routes through the current target

=====================
The Neet Shell Prompt
=====================
->	IN GLOBAL CONTEXT
	A prompt like this: [S:178][H:47 W:19 U:1 O:27] indicates that:
	178 instances of services have been found on the network
	47 Live hosts have been found, of which,
	19 are some flavour of Windows
	1 is some flavour of Unix
	and 27 are other OSs.

-> IN HOST CONTEXT
	A prompt like this: [128.98.9.15][Compromised][Windows] shows the IP address of the host you
	are working with, its condition, and its operating system family (if available).

==============
REPORTING AIDS
===============
nonames  -> Will show IP addresses in output, rather than hostnames. This is the default behaviour.
usenames -> Will show hostnames in output, rather than IP addresses.
useboth -> Will show IP addresses AND hostnames in output, where possible.
memo [message] -> Use with a message to add a time-stamped memo entry to the log. Use with no arguments
 		  to read all memo entries.

search <File> <string> -> Perform a search of all files beginning with "File" for string "string".
     Useful for compiling lists of results. 
     For example, look for all Compaq HTTP Servers of a particular version in Nikto results:
	    search nikto CompaqHTTPServer/9.9
     The search "find"s all files with names matching "nikto*", and greps them for the string "CompaqHTTPServer/9.9".
     You can list nearly all nikto output with this:
      search nikto +
     Another example, look for all weak SSL configurations:
      search issues "short keys"
     Look for all Accepted SSL/TLS ciphers:
      search sslscan Accept

iponly ->	Filter to show only IP addresses from command output.
	Example: svc https | iponly will show only the IP addresses of https services.
socket -> Filter to show only IP addresses and ports from command output.
	Example: svc https | socket will show only the IP addresses and ports of https services.

======================================
IN-SCAN TUNING AND MONITORING COMMANDS
======================================

budget -> Sets a new overall performance budget. The default value is set in the configuration file.
					The lower the budget, the fewer scans can run simultaneously. Use with no arguments to make neet
					display the current budget.
load   -> Set a new load average target for neet's automatic budget management.

disable <module> -> Disable the specified GSM module.
enable <module>  -> Re-enable a GSM module which has been disabled with the "disable" command.

threads -> Display all the Neet threads which are currently running.
queue   -> Show a list of the services queued for processing by the GSM
debug   -> toggle the debug level between 0,1,2 and 3.
gsmsummary -> Display a list of loaded GSM modules and the service files being watched by each.

cancel   -> (In host mode) Cancels all scans of the current host.

 Note: Do not use these two unless you really know how the modules work:
addinstance <module> -> Increments the Maximum allowed number of concurrent instances for the specified module.
delinstance <module> -> Decrements the Maximum allowed number of concurrent instances for the specified module.

wincreds -> Add credentials for accessing Windows machines

pause	-> Pauses the current scan. Same as CTRL-C in the main UI window.
=====================
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
=====================

A number of variables are set in the neet shell, depending on whether you're in host or global mode.

$IP	-> In host mode, this contains the IP address of the target host.
$LOCAL	-> In host mode, this contains the IP address of the nearest local interface to the target. This is usually
	   eth0, but if you are scanning from a number of interfaces, this will contain the IP address of the one
	   used to route to the target. Useful for setting up reverse connections back to your laptop.
$MSF2	-> Absolute path to neet's Metasploit 2 installation.
$MSF	-> Absolute path to system's Metasploit 4 installation.
